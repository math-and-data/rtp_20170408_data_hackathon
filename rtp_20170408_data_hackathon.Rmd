## Introduction
Welcome to the R-Ladies RTP Data Hackathon! We are using U.S. Hate Crime data for the last few years to build on our skills from previous R-Ladies workshops.  
1. [Getting Data into R](https://github.com/rladies/rtp-data-import-11-13-16): Ingesting data from outside data sources   
2. [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/rladies/rtp-data-manipulation-09-22-16): Wrangling with data, cleanup, ETL  
3. [Visualization with ggplot](https://github.com/rladies/rtp-data-viz-ggplot2-10-15-16): Visualizing data in charts, maps  
4. [Interactive visualization with Shiny](https://github.com/rladies/rtp_20170309_shiny): Interactive charting to explore the data  

## Dataset
We are interested in the yearly tables 12, 13, and 14 from the [U.S. Hate Crime data set] (https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime).  

## Pitfalls
[Don't draw early conclusions](https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use): places with fewer or no data points may not be doing better, they may just not report data or discurrage reporting.  
Understand the domain and data you are working with.
