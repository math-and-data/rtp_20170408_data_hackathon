## Introduction
Welcome to the R-Ladies RTP Data Hackathon! We are using U.S. Hate Crime data for the last few years to build on our skills from previous R-Ladies workshops.  
1. [Getting Data into R](https://github.com/rladies/rtp-data-import-11-13-16): Ingesting data from outside data sources   
2. [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/rladies/rtp-data-manipulation-09-22-16): Wrangling with data, cleanup, ETL  
3. [Visualization with ggplot](https://github.com/rladies/rtp-data-viz-ggplot2-10-15-16): Visualizing data in charts, maps  
4. [Interactive visualization with Shiny](https://github.com/rladies/rtp_20170309_shiny): Interactive charting to explore the data  

## Dataset
We are interested in the yearly tables 12, 13, and 14 from the [U.S. Hate Crime data set] (https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime).  

### Table 12  
Table 12 presents the following data for each state: the total number of participating agencies, the population represented, the number of agencies that submitted data about hate crime incidents, and the number of incidents reported.

### Table 13  
Table 13 provides the data from those agencies that reported that one or more hate crime incidents occurred in their respective jurisdictions during one or more quarters in the year.   
Tables 13 and 14 present the data by state, and each state is subdivided by agency type. Agency types include ``cities``, ``universities and colleges``, ``metropolitan counties``, ``nonmetropolitan counties``, ``state police agencies``, ``tribal agencies``, and ``other agencies``. The data published for universities and colleges represent crime reported only by those individual university/college law enforcement agencies that contributed to the UCR Program; the tables do not specify information about educational institutions that reported hate crime data via their local law enforcement agencies.

### Table 14  
Table 14 lists the agencies that indicated that no instances of hate crime occurred in their respective jurisdictions during the quarter(s) in 2015 for which they submitted reports.

## Pitfalls
[Don't draw early conclusions](https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use): places with fewer or no data points may not be doing better, they may just not report data or discurrage reporting.  
Understand the domain and data you are working with.
