## Introduction
Welcome to the R-Ladies RTP Data Hackathon! We are using U.S. Hate Crime data for the last few years to build on our skills from previous R-Ladies workshops.  
1. [Getting Data into R](https://github.com/rladies/rtp-data-import-11-13-16): Ingesting data from outside data sources   
2. [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/rladies/rtp-data-manipulation-09-22-16): Wrangling with data, cleanup, ETL  
3. [Visualization with ggplot](https://github.com/rladies/rtp-data-viz-ggplot2-10-15-16): Visualizing data in charts, maps  
4. [Interactive visualization with Shiny](https://github.com/rladies/rtp_20170309_shiny): Interactive charting to explore the data  

## Datasets
We are interested in the yearly tables 12, 13, and 14 from the [U.S. Hate Crime data set](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime). Each year has its own tables and links. The links are not consistent over the years.  
![Website Year Layout](https://github.com/math-and-data/rtp_20170408_data_hackathon/blob/master/screenshot_website_years.PNG)  

The [site URLs for 2013-2015](https://github.com/math-and-data/rtp_20170408_data_hackathon/blob/master/url_links_to_hate_crime_data.csv) are available as a csv file as well.  
Each year has a main page, which links to the tables (somewhere on the right side):

etc.  

### Table 12  
For each state, we have the total number of **participating agencies**, the **population** represented, the **number of agencies that submitted data** about hate crime incidents, and the **number of incidents reported**.  
![Table12 Layout](https://github.com/math-and-data/rtp_20170408_data_hackathon/blob/master/screenshot_table_12.PNG)  

### Table 13  
Tables 13 and 14 present the data by state, and each state is subdivided by ``agency type``. Agency types include ``cities``, ``universities and colleges``, ``metropolitan counties``, ``nonmetropolitan counties``, ``state police agencies``, ``tribal agencies``, and ``other agencies``. The data published for universities and colleges represent crime reported only by those individual university/college law enforcement agencies that contributed to the UCR Program; the tables do not specify information about educational institutions that reported hate crime data via their local law enforcement agencies.  
Table 13 provides the data from those agencies that reported that **one or more hate crime incidents occurred** in their respective jurisdictions during one or more quarters in the year.  
![Table13 Layout](https://github.com/math-and-data/rtp_20170408_data_hackathon/blob/master/screenshot_table_13.PNG)  

### Table 14  
Table 14 lists the agencies that indicated that **no instances of hate crime occurred** in their respective jurisdictions during the quarter(s) in the year for which they submitted reports.

### Links to retrieve the tables
#### Links to data declarations (have links to pdf versions, very inconsistent naming of the pdf files; just grab the text from this instead)

### Random footnotes in the data
Hawaii does not participate in the Hate Crime Statistics Program.  
The URLs are not consistent and change year over year.  
Blank vs. 0:  Blanks in any of the four columns under "Number of incidents per quarter" in table 13 indicate that an agency did not submit a report for that particular quarter.  


## Brainstorming
* How can we automate the data retrieval from the website and the formatting?
* What questions can we ask? What visualizations can we show?
* Will the data be sufficient to support answering the question?
* Which outside data should be brought in?


## Pitfalls
[Don't draw early conclusions](https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use): places with fewer or no data points may not be doing better, they may just not report data or discourage reporting.  
Understand the domain and data you are working with.
